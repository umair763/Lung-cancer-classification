## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify lung cancer images into three categories:
- Adenocarcinoma
- Benign (non-cancerous)
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma

The project consists of:
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.
- Flask API to handle image uploads and predictions.
- A complete front-end interface for seamless user interaction.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset contains lung cancer images categorized into three classes:
- Adenocarcinoma
- Benign
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma

### Dataset Organization
The images are organized into three main directories:
- Train: Training data
- Validation: Validation data
- Test: Testing data

## 4. Requirements
### Dependencies
To run this project, install the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

Install the dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. How to Run the Project
### Step 1: Train the Model
Run the following command to train the CNN model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

### Step 2: Run the Flask App
Launch the Flask web server with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Step 3: Use the Front-End Interface
- Open the web application in your browser.
- Upload a lung cancer image.
- View the predicted class (Adenocarcinoma, Benign, or Squamous Cell Carcinoma).

## 6. Model Architecture
The CNN model has the following architecture:

| Layer            | Details                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Conv2D + ReLU    | 32 filters, kernel size 3x3    |
| MaxPooling2D     | Pool size 2x2                  |
| Conv2D + ReLU    | 64 filters, kernel size 3x3    |
| MaxPooling2D     | Pool size 2x2                  |
| Flatten          | -                              |
| Dense + ReLU     | 128 units                      |
| Dropout          | 50% dropout rate               |
| Dense + Softmax  | 3 output units (3 classes)     |

## 7. Flask Integration
The Flask backend serves as an API to:
- Accept uploaded images.
- Preprocess images for the model.
- Return predictions to the user.

### Key Route:
```python
@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def upload_and_predict():
    # Handles image upload, model prediction, and result display
```

## 8. Front-End Interface
The front-end interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It allows users to:
- Upload lung cancer images.
- View the predictions in a clean and modern design.

### Features:
- Simple file upload section.
- Display of uploaded images.
- Dynamic prediction results display.

## 9. Features
- **Lung Cancer Image Classification**: Predicts classes (Adenocarcinoma, Benign, Squamous Cell Carcinoma).
- **Flask Backend**: Real-time model predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern and intuitive design for uploading and viewing results.
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves model generalization.

## 10. Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

Results are displayed for:
- Training data
- Validation data
- Test data

## 11. Results
- Training Accuracy: ~95%
- Validation Accuracy: ~93%
- Test Accuracy: ~92%

## 12. Future Improvements
- Add Transfer Learning using pre-trained models like ResNet or InceptionV3.
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- Add detailed visualization of Grad-CAM to show areas of focus in images.
